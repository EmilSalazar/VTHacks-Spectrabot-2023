### Description:
Spectrabot is an online DEI consultant suited for 

You post a job listing and the AI will provide ways to improve it to become more inclusive. 

> [!NOTE]
> How to use: 

>[!IMPORTANT]
> An OpenAI API key is required to run the program

### _What was our motivation?_ 
We were inspired by the DEI Program Action Team and our personal experiences as minorities in tech. In the U.S., 22% of tech workers are ethnic minorities and 25% of black computer science students don't know anyone in Big Tech. After experiencing the lack of exposure regarding minorities in tech first-hand, we sought out to help reduce the diversity, equity, and inclusion disparity.

### _Why did we create Spectrabot?_
We built Spectrabot so that employers could ensure job listings that are inclusive and attract a diverse pool of candidates.  

### _What problem does it solve?_
The lack of workforce diversity in the technology sector of the U.S. 

### _What makes a job listing inclusive?_  
| Inclusive | Non-Inclusive |
|:----------:|:--------------:|
|Gender-neutral|Gendered Language|
|Skill-based|Unnecessary Qualifications|
|Straightforward Language|Technical Jargon|
|Benefits Listed|Ommitting Benefits|

### _What makes our project standout_
A lot of people don't know how to utilize ChatGPT to the fullest.
Spectrabot 
gives them *questionnaires(details/description) to help build the right prompt that specifically solve the problem that were focusing on.
