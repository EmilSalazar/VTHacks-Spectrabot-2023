### Description:
Spectrabot is an online DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) consultant powered by OpenAI, designed to optimize inclusivity in job listings. The AI model targets businesses that want to emphasize diversity in their company culture. Employers can easily submit a draft of their job listing to Spectrabot, which then generates recommendations that enhance the job listing, making it more inclusive and appealing to a diverse range of potential candidates. 

> [!NOTE]
> **How to use:** Simply copy and paste your job listing into the text box and wait patiently for Spectrabot to provide you with a response. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
> An OpenAI API key is required to run the program

### _What makes our project standout_
What sets Spectrabot apart from ChatGPT and other AI models is its specialized focus on growing and maintaining inclusivity in the workforce. Many people are unaware of ChatGPT's full potential due to the challenge of envisioning it's endless possibilities. Spectrabot, on the other hand, is intentionally designed and advertised to enhance DEI. In doing so, it raises more awareness to the necessity of inclusivity in the workforce staring from the very beginning of the hiring process. 

### _What was our motivation?_ 
We were inspired by the DEI Program Action Team and our personal experiences as minorities in tech. In the U.S., 22% of tech workers are ethnic minorities and 25% of black computer science students don't know anyone in Big Tech. After experiencing the lack of exposure regarding minorities in tech first-hand, we sought out to help reduce the diversity, equity, and inclusion disparity.

### _Why did we create Spectrabot?_
We built Spectrabot so that employers could ensure their job listings are inclusive and appealing to a diverse pool of candidates.  

### _What problem does it solve?_
Spectrabot hopes to improve the diversity in the U.S. by increasing accessibility to inclusivity.
